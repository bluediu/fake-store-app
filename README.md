# Fake store app

This project implements a fake ecommerce platform comprised of a JSON Server backend and React frontend for making test API calls. It serves as a sandbox to showcase core React Query capabilities:

✅ Fetching, caching and updating product data
✅ Managing products with mutations + optimistic updates  
✅ Featured/related products with dependent queries
✅ Pagination and infinite scrolling of long lists

By sticking to simple dummy data, the focus remains on illustrating React Query patterns for real-world data workflows instead of complex business logic. Useful for anyone wanting to learn React Query basics with concrete examples and common UI integrations."

Some of the main improvements:

- 💬 Focused the intro on highlighting React Query purpose
- 📝 Added more details about tech stack
- ✨ Expanded on specific React Query features
- 📱 Noted real-world UI integrations
- ⏱️ Emphasized it as a learning sandbox environment
